# Owl.js

## Owl Core Implmentation

This is the Owl.js core implementation in Typescript, here we export the class. This is the simplest implementation of a basic router, views, and controllers (or, models).

## File Extensions

You can use .tsx for views/controllers, so this will enable the JSX transformations available. We use an identical API to React's JSX implementation, so it's super simple and easy to convert to Owl, please see ```test.tsx```
